# Drum Kit 

This project is a simple drum kit implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboards.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/drum-kit.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. Once the web page is loaded, you will see a collection of drum buttons on the screen, each representing a different drum sound.

4. Press the corresponding keys on your keyboard or click on the drum buttons with your mouse to play the sounds.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page and includes the necessary JavaScript and CSS files.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling rules for the drum kit interface.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the key events and plays the appropriate drum sound when a key is pressed or a button is clicked.

- `sounds/`: A directory that contains the audio files for each drum sound. You can add or modify sounds by placing your own audio files in this directory and updating the corresponding code in `script.js`.
